# For You — Romantic Static Site (test-static-ui)

A small, private static website crafted as a romantic surprise. Includes a soft-themed home, moments, and an interactive birthday page with animated candles, mic-based "blow" detection, and heart-colored confetti.

Notes:
- Netlify supports deploying from private GitHub repositories; when connecting Netlify to GitHub you'll need to grant the Netlify app access to this repository.
- Browsers may block autoplayed audio — use the Play button or tap the cake if the melody doesn't start automatically.
